My name is **Rui Luo** (**骆睿** in Chinese) and I'm currently working towards the Ph.D degree at University of Macau. Prior to that, I received B.Sc degree from Wuhan University in 2017 and M.Sc degree from Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology in 2020.

It's an exciting thing for me to broaden horizon on different areas continually. I've done some research on neuromorphic computing during the past few years, which mainly includes brain-inspired computing and memristive neural networks on hardware. And now, my research topics mainly focus on machine learning and its applications on coginitive computing, brain-related issues and some medical problems.
