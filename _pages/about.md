My name is **Zhiri Tang** (**汤知日** in Chinese) and I'm currently working towards the Ph.D. Degree at the Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong. Prior to that, I received B.Sc and M.Eng degree from Wuhan University in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

It's an exciting thing for me to broaden horizon on different areas continually. I've done some research on neuromorphic computing during the past few years, which mainly includes brain-inspired computing and memristive neural networks on hardware. And now, my research topics mainly focus on machine learning and its applications, in which pedestrians detection is one of the main applications I need to do during my Ph.D career. Apart from computer vision, I also have some collaborative research on cognitive diagnosis, sound localization, medical image processing, and image quality assessment.
