My name is **Rui Luo** (**骆睿** in Chinese) and I'm currently working towards the Ph.D degree at University of Macau. Prior to that, I received B.Sc degree from Wuhan University in 2017 and M.Sc degree from Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology in 2020.

It's an exciting thing for me to broaden horizon on different areas continually. I've done some research on mm-wave circuit design during the master's, which mainly includes mm-wave reflect-type balanced vector modulator design and RF measurement. And now, my research topics mainly focus on ultra-low power circuit desing for IoT applicaiton.
